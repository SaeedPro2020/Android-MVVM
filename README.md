## MVVM
### This is a demo app which it designed based on MVVM pattern in a mobile architecture. 
   There is a lot of things that we can do to improve the App including
   
   #### 1- add more dimensions value for different screen sizes.
   
   #### 2- add different strings inside "res.values" for different languages
   
   #### 3- add more icons and animations to make UI more appealing
   
   #### 4- in terms of more development, since app would grows and we would have more classes, it would be better to transform architecture from MVVM to "Clean architecture" or other architectures.
